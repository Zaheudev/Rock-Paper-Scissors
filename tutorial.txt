TUTORIAL ON HOW TO USE THE APP
#####

STEPS ON HOW TO OPEN THE APP
    1- First you have to open the server by opening your cmd on the path of /website folder or /website/server and type 'npm start'
    eg "C:\Users\user\Desktop\client-2\website>" then type command "npm start" (btw without quotation marks)
    you should see printed on console "Server started on port 3001" and maybe the database rows if there are any

    2- Second you have to open the client by opening your cmd on the path of /website/client and type 'npm start'
    eg "C:\Users\user\Desktop\client-2\website/client>" then type command "npm start" (btw without quotation marks)

    3- Make sure the both client and server are opened and if you encounter errors make sure you are on the right path
    (NOTE: if that doesen't work you don't have node.js installed on your machine);
    4- Then if both servers are open open your browser and type "localhost:3000"

RULES
    1- DO NOT ENTER SENSITIVE DATA ON REGISTER PAGE, all the data will be stored on storage.db and it's not secure at all now.
    2- If you want to test the multiplayer feature you have to one more browser for the other client because if you logged in you 
    remain logged in even if you refrsh or quit the tab (not storing any ips or anything like that, just a bool and a string with name
    on localStorage from any browser) and that doese'nt make possible to play with bot clients from the same browser because it's the same account.

ABOUT THE APP
    1- The app is built in the way that every logic of the game is verified on server, so that means it cannot be sending any messages to 'hack' the app
    if you change any data stored on the browser will only make effect on front-end not on the back-end because there is logic to check every message.
    2- The multiplayer feature only works with random users for now.

This is just a demo made in a week so don't take in serious the bugs if you encounter some. In the future versions will be fixed.
